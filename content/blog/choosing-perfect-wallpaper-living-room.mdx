Your living room is the heart of your home - it's where you relax, entertain, and spend quality time with family. Choosing the right wallpaper can transform this space into something truly special.

## Consider Your Room's Size

The size of your living room plays a crucial role in wallpaper selection:

### Small Living Rooms

* Opt for light colors to create an illusion of space
* Vertical stripes can make ceilings appear higher
* Avoid large, busy patterns that can overwhelm

### Large Living Rooms

* Bold patterns and dark colors work beautifully
* Large-scale designs create drama
* Consider feature walls to define zones

## Understanding Pattern Scale

Pattern scale should be proportionate to your room:

* **Small patterns** - Work well in cozy spaces
* **Medium patterns** - Versatile for most rooms
* **Large patterns** - Best for spacious areas or accent walls

## Color Psychology

Colors affect mood and perception:

| Color  | Effect                |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| Blue   | Calming, serene       |
| Green  | Refreshing, natural   |
| Yellow | Energizing, cheerful  |
| Grey   | Sophisticated, modern |
| Beige  | Warm, welcoming       |

## Matching Your Decor Style

### Modern Minimalist

* Geometric patterns
* Neutral tones
* Subtle textures

### Traditional

* Damask patterns
* Floral designs
* Rich colors

### Bohemian

* Bold prints
* Mixed patterns
* Vibrant colors

### Scandinavian

* Light colors
* Simple patterns
* Natural textures

## Lighting Considerations

Always consider your room's lighting:

1. **North-facing rooms** - Choose warm tones to counteract cool light
2. **South-facing rooms** - Any color works well with abundant natural light
3. **Artificial lighting** - Test samples under your actual light fixtures

## Making the Final Decision

Before committing:

1. Order samples and tape them to your wall
2. View samples at different times of day
3. Consider how the pattern connects at seams
4. Think about longevity - will you still love it in 5 years?
